This code leverages 5 built-in Functional Interfaces: 
(i) the Function/BiFunction Functional Interface turns one/two parameter(s) into a value of a potentially different type and returns this value.
(ii) the Consumer/BiConsumer Functional Interface accepts/manipulates one/two parameter(s), but does not return anything.
(iii) the Predicate/BiPredicate Functional Interface may be used to test a condition (often used when filtering or matching); Predicate returns a boolean value.
(iv) the Supplier Functional Interface may be used to generate or supply values without taking any input.
(v) Comparator â€“ used to specify that you want to use a different order than the object itself provides.  When you want to sort an object that did not implement Comparable, or you want to sort objects in different ways at different times.  Comparator is a functional interface because it has a single abstract method.
